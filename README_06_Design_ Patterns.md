- **Iterator Design Pattern** is about accessing the elements of a container without exposing the structure of the object.  
  For example to traverse any collection we used to use the conventional for loop in which with index we come to know everything about the structure of the object whereas with iterator we don't expose the internal representation of the object we are traversing.
